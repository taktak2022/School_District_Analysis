# School_District_Analysis_Challenge
## Module 4 Pandas and Jupyter Notebook Classwork
*Learn about the Pandas libraries and their use in a Jupyter Notebook platform.
*Further knowledge in Python functions and syntax as it applies to Jupyter Notebook. 
*Creating, formatting and interpreting DataFrames to perform specific calculations.


## Overview
Using key factors and metrics, an analysis of several schools in different districts were evaluated.
The focus of the analysis was on the passing grades of math and reading, which was further broken up by grade levels in each school and district.
This was further scrutinized by the type of school, charter or district and its budget per district, per school.
Finally, the Challenge portion gave us a new set of factors to consider, focusing on Thomas High School and how to re-evaluate the given information with the deletion of it's 9th grade class level and how that would affect the data in comparison with the original dataset conclusions.

## Comparisons and Conclusions
With the removal of the 9th grade students from Thomas High School, the data changed as follows:
*Average Math Score: 78.99%
*New Average Math Score: 78.93%

*Average Reading Score: 81.88%
*New Average Reading Score: 81.86%

*Count of students passing Math: 29370
*New Count of students passing Math: 28939

*Count of students passing Reading: 33610
*New Count of students passing Reading: 33158

*Percentage of Passing Math students: 74.98%
*New Percentage of Passing Math students: 74.76%

*Percentage of Passing Reading students: 85.80%
*New Percentage of Passing Reading students: 85.65%

*Overall Count and Percentage of Passing Math & Reading students: 25528 students = 65.17%
*New Overall Count and Percentage of Passing Math & Reading students: 25105 students = 64.86%

As you can see by these calculation comparisons, the percentage difference is far less than 0.5% which seens negligible but amounts to about 400 students.

### Thomas High School (School Summary comparison)

When we focus the analysis on the differences with Thomas High School in particular, with the removal of the 9th grade students information, we get the following results:

#### School Summary - Thomas High School
*Percentage of Passing Math students: 93.27%
*New Percentage of Passing Math students: 66.91%

*Percentage of Passing Reading students: 97.31%
*New Percentage of Passing Reading students: 69.66%

*Overall Passing Percentage of Math and Reading students: 90.95%
*New Overall Passing Percentage of Math and Reading students: 65.08%

The differences here cannot be ignored as it is significant.  The percentages drop dramatically so as Thomas High School is a charter school, some questions will have to be addressed as to how the budget is asertained and how it is utilized.  This is in reflection of the fact that the top performing schools are all charter schools as compared to the district school performance percentages.

Further research can determine whether resources and funds that are allocated to various school infrastructure, teaching staff and even teaching staff per student class counts which could make a difference in the fluctuations of these math and reading passing percentages in these schools and in the districts they are located in.  With larger schools in more populated districts, oppurtunites for obtaining passing levels can be met with these metrics and how they are analyzed and utilized.
